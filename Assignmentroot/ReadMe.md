## Steps Taken to Complete the Assignment

### 1. Project Setup
- Initialized the project using **React and TypeScript**
- Completed basic configuration and updated the application title
- Set up a clean and scalable folder structure

### 2. Base UI & Flow Structure
- Implemented the **Account Type selection** screen (Personal / Business)
- Defined a clear **multi-step onboarding flow**
- Matched the overall layout and structure to the Figma design

### 3. Core Feature Implementation
- Added support for **OTP and password-based flows**
- Implemented step-wise navigation with proper state handling
- Added dialog support for the final confirmation step

### 4. Interactions, Validation & Error Handling
- Implemented all relevant interaction states:
  - Hover, focus, active, disabled, and loading states
- Added **form validations** and clear error messages for invalid or empty inputs
- Improved conditional logic to handle edge cases gracefully

### 5. UI Refinement & Iterations
- Performed multiple UI and logic iterations to improve accuracy and usability
- Refined spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy to closely match Figma
- Cleaned and optimized CSS for consistency across components

### 6. Responsiveness & Accessibility
- Made the layout and images fully responsive across screen sizes
- Improved focus handling and keyboard accessibility
- Ensured usability on both desktop and smaller devices

### 7. Animations & Transitions
- Added subtle and tasteful animations to enhance user experience
- Used transitions for step changes and user interactions without overdoing effects

### 8. Optimization & Cleanup
- Removed Firebase after reassessing project requirements
- Removed unused and unnecessary libraries
- Simplified logic and improved overall maintainability

### 9. Deployment
- Performed a final QA pass covering UI accuracy and interaction states
- Deployed the application and verified the production build
- Shared both the **live deployment link** and **source code** for review
